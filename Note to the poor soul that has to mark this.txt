Although I'm fairly certain the code has everything it needs to work in this zip file, I've included the outputted results just in case.
ImplicitModel is the solver and ImplictObj is the objective function. I'm not a fan of the names (Implict is misspelled for example), 
but didn't want to break things by changing them.
